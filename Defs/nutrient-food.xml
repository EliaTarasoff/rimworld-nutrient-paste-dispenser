        <label>nutrient brick meal</label>
        <description>Dehydrated nutrient paste, wrapped in polymer made from inedible food-parts. The dehydration, and polymer-wrapping process for nutrient paste was invented to keep people alive on long-haul cargo routes. Unfortunately, it tastes just as bad as nutrient paste...that's also been burned a little. Rumored to have been invented by a scientist who liked historical films starring Charlton Heston, and hated everyone else. At least it's better than eating kibble.</description>
