        <!--
        This definition, is to override the base-game hopper, since my NPD doesn't make use of it.
        i.e. Make empty building with same name, that isn't listed anywhere to build.
        Many things reference it, so I can't just remove it with a patch:
            "Failed to find Verse.ThingDef named Hopper. There are 1178 defs of this type loaded."
