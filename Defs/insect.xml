                <description>Not only did I consume nutrient-paste from a tube, but it was made from gray, slimy insect meat. The gear-oil from the machine partly covered the taste, but the texture and aftertaste were still easily identifiable.</description>

                <description>Not only did I consume a brick of dehydrated nutrient-paste, but it was made from gray, slimy insect meat. The gear-oil and burnt flavor from the machine partly covered the taste, but the texture and aftertaste were still easily identifiable.</description>
