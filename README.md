The official Nutrient Paste Dispenser in Rimworld is a bit old, and has some problems:
- pawns constantly coming to restock the hoppers (they always try to keep them at max stacks)
    - this goes against the building's description, that it's a low-effort way to make food
- have to manually set (or copy) the stockpile for each hopper
- have to build and repair separate hoppers
- instantaneous paste-production felt weird to me

This mod addresses that, by making the NPD work like a BiofuelRefinery / Stove / work-bench.
The meals now take time to produce, but are still faster than simple meals, to keep in theme with the original machine.
The nutrients can be made singly (low on resources) or in large batches (slight speed boost).
Batches also mean pawns aren't constantly hauling to it, even if you don't want to micromanage small stockpiles.
(I feel like that's in line with the original machine - low-effort, but terrible food.)

Also changed / added:
- dehydrated nutrient bricks, as a bad replacement for packaged survival meals or pemmican.
    - (Slower and tastier than kibble, however, again like survival meals or pemmican.)
- nutrient paste research and packaged survival meal research is more expensive
- additional research
    - fruit leather
    - nutrient bricks
    - insect nutrients
    - human nutrients
- ascetics get a small mood bonus from nutrient paste (and bricks)
- kibble and pemmican store in bigger stacks
    - at 75 units, there's less total nutrition per space than simple meals, even counting the raw ingredients
    - they're both dried foods, but somehow raw, wet meat and vegetables take up the same space
