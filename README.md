The official Nutrient Paste Dispenser in Rimworld is a bit old, and has some problems:
- pawns constantly coming to restock the hoppers (they always try to keep them at max stacks)
- have to manually set (or copy) the stockpile for each hopper
- have to build and repair separate hoppers
- it can be used to make (bad) meals (nearly) infinitely quickly (balance!), for short caravans

This mod addresses that, by making the NPD work like a BiofuelRefinery / Stove.
(Those are both subclasses of work-bench.)
The meals now take time to produce, although are still fairly quick, to keep in theme with the original machine.
The production is in batches, so pawns aren't constantly hauling to it, even if you don't want to micromanage small stockpiles.
(I feel like that's in line with the original machine - low-effort, but terrible food.)
I also added dehydrated nutrient bricks, as a bad replacement for packaged survival meals or pemmican.
