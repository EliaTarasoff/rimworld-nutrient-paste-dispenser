The official Nutrient Paste Dispenser in Rimworld is a bit old, and has some problems:
- pawns constantly coming to restock it
- have to manually set (or copy) the stockpile for each hopper
- have to build and repair separate hoppers
- it can be used to make (bad) meals (nearly) infinitely quickly, for short caravans
- I don't like how they need to be refrigerated, even though they've already got lots of complex machinery inside 

My aim is to fix NPDs, generally by:
- make NPDs refueled with foodstuffs similar to wood-fueled stoves or wood-fueled reactors, since pawns only refuel those when they're low
- get rid of hoppers entirely
- rebalance everything, so its roughly in line with where it was previously

I get non-refrigeration for free, by making them refueled.
Unfortunately, this means I need separate buildings for each food type (plants, meat, insect, human),
because the "fuel" can be any item, but you can't have separate fuels, or only use up certain foods for certain pastes.
I think that's a decent trade-off.
